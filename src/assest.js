    review:
      '"My son is 12 and has been on this medication for about a year. His grades are very good and he is able to focus so much more than he ever did before. He started on the lowest dose and is now taking 36 mg. However, his anxiety is getting so bad it&#039;s almost scary. He is so nervous to do so many things he ends up vomiting almost once a week. He would rather be home with his parents than be with his friends and he wouldn&#039;t dare spend the night at someone elses house(even family members). I love that this medicine has helped him so much, but I think it is also causing a lot of problems within him."',

      '"I started off with a sample pack of these and then I decided to be prescribed the birth control pills. MY MISTAKE. At first I liked the pill, I didn&#039;t adjust to it long enough I guess for all of the negative side effects to take place. Reading other peoples reviews made me feel A LOT better about what has been happening to me. DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL. I used to be really happy all of the time and I was just starting to lose weight. This pill brought my weight loss to a complete halt.  This pill made me gain some weight back even though I was working really hard toward my weight loss goals. Also, this pill turned me into a crazy person, I get moody and cry for no reason. it is negatively effecting my long time relationship with my boyfriend."',

I noticed some improvement in overall skin tone and complexion that I hadn&#039;t seen before, which is nice. But I gained about 6-7 lbs, and I feel bloated almost all the time. I have been working out hard for a month now, watching what I ate even MORE and I have lost a mere 2 lbs.... extremely disappointing. This pill may have made me more irritable and PMS-y at times, my periods are the same, not lighter. I really hate the fact that I eat so healthy and work out so much and see no improvements in my body. I&#039;ve never had to work so hard to lose even 2 lbs, so I&#039;m switching to Yaz."',
